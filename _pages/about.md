I completed my doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in May 2023. Throughout my Ph.D. program, I served as a graduate student researcher (GSR) at UCLA's Center for Smart Health, focusing on medical data analytics, causal inference, cloud computing, and IoTs. Under the guidance of Dr. Ramin Ramezani, my advisor (whose webpage can be found at http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~ramin/), I conducted research in these areas.

Before joining UCLA, I pursued two Master of Science degrees, one in Computer Science and another in Electrical Engineering, at the University of Southern California (USC). During my time at USC, I collaborated with Prof. Kai Hwang (whose information can be found at https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/content/8523), who currently holds the position of Presidential Chair Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Shenzhen, China. Additionally, Prof. Hwang serves as the Chief Scientist at the Cloud Computing Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research at USC primarily focused on cloud computing and IoTs.
