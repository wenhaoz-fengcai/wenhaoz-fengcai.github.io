I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I also work as a graduate student researcher (GSR) at [Center for Smart Health](https://www.risksciences.ucla.edu/smart-health) at UCLA. My research interests are medical data analytics and causal inference. I also work on cloud computing and IoTs. My advisor is [Dr. Ramin Ramezani](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~ramin/). 


Prior to joining UCLA, I received my MSc in Computer Science and another MSc in Electrical Engineering at University of Southern California (USC). At USC, I worked on cloud computing and IoTs research with [Prof. Kai Hwang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/content/8523), who is presently a Presidential Chair Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Shenzhen, China and Chief Scientist at the Cloud Computing Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
