Happy Chinese Spring Festival 2019! A new year gift for my beloved open-source community: a light-weight text-based dictionary application called, [wkdict](https://pypi.org/project/wkdict/) has just been released for this special occasion! This cross-platform program talks with Wiktionary's [API](https://www.wiktionary.org) with the requested query(i.e. A single English word), and parses the returned JSON object in to a clean and readable format. The following snapshot gives you a taste of what this application looks like:
